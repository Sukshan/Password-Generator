1. Generating a Password:
	The user answers with "Yes" or "No" to questions about using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols.
	The user then enters the desired length of the password.
	A password alphabet is generated based on the user's answers, which is a string containing the chosen characters.
	Random characters from the password alphabet are selected and combined to form a completely random string according to the user's preferences.
	The randomly generated password is then displayed on the console.



2. Checking a Password's Strength:
	This determines the strength of the password given by the user(weak/medium/good/great).

3. Displaying Useful Information:
	This is a minor feature that displays information for the user on the console about password security, such as avoiding using the same password twice, avoiding character repetition, keyboard patterns, dictionary words, letter or number sequences, etc.
